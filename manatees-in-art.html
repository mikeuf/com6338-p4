                        <p>Manatees have fascinated and inspired artists for decades. Their seemlingly, impossibly
                            gentle nature has long made them the subject of both affection and humor. Here's a sample
                            of some of the artwork that has been created for manatees.</p>

                        <p>The manatee has been linked to folklore on mermaids. Native Americans ground the bones to
                            treat asthma and earache. In West African folklore, they were considered sacred and thought
                            to have been once human. Killing one was taboo and required penance.
                    </div>



                    <div class="art-blurb">
                        <p>The manatees were shown to be living in a tank at FOX Studios which was filled with "idea
                            balls." The manatees randomly selected the idea balls to make the jokes for the show. They
                            are also revealed as being "the only animal unmoved by terrorist threats."</p>

                    <div class="art-blurb">
                        <p>The manatee is also pivotal in Lair of the Leviathan, the third episode of the game Tales of
                            Monkey Island, by Telltale Games and Lucasarts. From manatee hides, Native Americans made
                            war shields, canoes, and shoes, though manatees were predominantly hunted for their
                            abundant meat.</p>

                    <div class="art-blurb">
                        <p>Later, manatees were hunted for their bones, which were used to make "special potions".
                            Until the 1800s, museums paid as much as $100 for bones or hides. Though hunting was banned
                            in 1893, poaching continues today.</p>
